=====================================================

This is a simple DDoS Detector written in C under
assistance of pcap library. It measures PPS(Packets Per
Second), BPS(Bytes Per Second), TCP failed connection ratio
to determine whether certain traffic is DDoS traffic or not.
This application can run on Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit system. 
Compatibility to other version of Linux kernel and 
Ubuntu is not guaranteed.

This application captures packets from primary NIC(network
interface card) for doing detector service. Traffic
statistics will be printed out on the screen every 1 second.
Of course, in order to capture packets, this process requires
sudo privilege! You should be aware of it.

This application will show unexpected behavior when poor arguments
(like not number) are given.

I count TCP successful connection for only TCP succesful 3-way
handshake. When handshake not done in timeout(30seconds) or other flags
come out between SYN - SYNACK - ACK sequence, or wrong sequence number or
SYN flood, all of them are counted as failed. If same seq # SYN comes, it
is considered as retransmission and counted as one failure

=====================================================
                 
                  Installation

=====================================================

This part shows prerequisites for using this application.
I did not use any specialized libraries, but uses pcap
library for capturing packets. So in order to compile my
code, it is required to install libpcap-dev, first
(Not libpcap, but libpcap-dev). If you are trying to
use this application from the scratch, basic components like
build-essential, libtool, automake, autoconf are required.
(Some of them may not be necessary) In this directory,
there is an installation script as described above. Run the
installation script first, and then change directory into
the src directory. You should execute make command to create
an executable!


=====================================================

              Running the Application

=====================================================

It is very easy to run this program.

Execution command is like below.
 
   sudo ./dd [-pps packets_per_second] [-bps bytes_per_second] [-tcp tcp_fail_ratio]

One of three options must be given to detect DDoS.
Also sudo privilege is required as mentioned earlier.

                  Code Repository

=====================================================

My code is public, so it is available on online.
Here is a link to my Github repository.
