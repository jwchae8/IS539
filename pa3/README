=====================================================

This is a botnet written in C
It is consist of three levels of hierarchy.
The top level is bot-master.
It receives command from attacker and broadcast it around super bots.
Super bots then forward commands to child bots.
They also manage the status of child bots.
Child bots are doing attacks(sending packets) or creating files
It consists of single binary

                 ------------
                 |Bot master|
                 ------------

=====================================================
                 
                  Installation

=====================================================

This part shows prerequisites for using this application.
I did not use any specialized libraries. If you are trying to
use this application from the scratch, basic components like
build-essential, libtool, automake, autoconf are required.
(Some of them may not be necessary) In this directory,
there is an installation script as described above. Run the
installation script first, and then change directory into
the src directory. You should execute make command to create
an executable!


=====================================================

              Running the Application

=====================================================

It is very easy to run this program.

Execution command is like below.
 
   sudo ./botnet

Then it offers cli interface to the user.

There are six commands available in cli interface.

show 
    : shows every instance of child bots

search [child_bot_id]...
    : shows status of certain child bots

read [-date|-host] [child_bot_id]...
    : shows system date or host name of certain child bots

create [filename] [child_bot_id]...
    : creates a file with name filename_id

send [pkts num] [host:ip] [child_bot_id]...
    : sends UDP packets to target machine with several child bots

quit
    : quit the application

If you quit the application(or ctrl-c), TCP connection between bots
are remained so if you want to reboot bot master then please patiently
wait for a half of minute(timeout of TCP).
